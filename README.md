# Scellmate

Scellmate is a contamination-aware, open-reference Snakemake pipeline for large-scale microbial single-cell genomics. It performs two-stage quality control of Single-Amplified Genomes (SAGs), builds context-specific reference databases, assembles and clusters SAGs into high-quality composite SAGs (CoSAGs), reconstructs non-redundant mobile genetic element (eMGE) catalogs, and finally links SAGs to their resident eMGEs.

## Features

- **Modular**: each step can be run independently or as part of an end-to-end workflow  
- **Contamination-aware**: dual QC stages (reference-based and co-assembly) to remove contaminated or chimeric SAGs  
- **Adaptive subsetting**: builds a context-specific Kraken2 database from GTDB plus de-novo eMGEs  
- **Iterative co-assembly**: clusters SAGs into provisional CoSAGs at 97% ANI, flags overfitting, and refines clusters  
- **Comprehensive eMGE recovery**: de-novo detection, clustering, extension with CoSAG contigs, and non-redundant catalog building  
- **Hostâ€“mobilome linkage**: stringent two-step filtering to generate high-confidence presence/absence matrices
